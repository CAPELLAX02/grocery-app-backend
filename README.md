## Motivation

The **Grocery Store - Backend Project** aims to simplify the backend setup for developers working on e-commerce applications. By offering a robust API template, this project allows developers to focus on crafting unique user experiences on the frontend while leveraging pre-built, scalable backend features. Key motivations include:

1. Reducing development overhead for client-side teams.
2. Demonstrating modern backend design best practices.
3. Providing a ready-to-use API that integrates essential e-commerce functionality.

Whether you're developing a grocery delivery app or exploring backend concepts, this project provides a reliable starting point.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
2. Ensure you have **Java 17** and **Maven** installed if running locally.

### Run with Docker

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CAPELLAX02/grocery-app-backend.git
   cd grocery-app-backend
   ```

2. **Start the application with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
- Base URL of the API will be live on `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`.

---

## Sample Data

- There is a sample `products.json` file in the `/src/main/resources/static` directory. 
- You can import this json file to your MongoDB database via either MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB Compass.
- Additionally, you can edit all the product fields in the json file before loading the sample data to the database. For example, for better user experience, you can change the dummy `imageURL` links with actual product image URLs. 
 
---

## Environment Variables

There is a `yml` file named `example.application.yml` in the `src/main/resources` directory. You should change the name of this file as `application.yml`, and change the following environment variables for your convenience:

#### `spring.data.mongodb.uri`: 
- The MongoDB connection URI.
- Example: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database_name`.
- To set up MongoDB Atlas, [follow this guide](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database).

#### `spring.data.mongodb.database`: 
- The name of your MongoDB database.

#### `spring.mail.host`: 
- The SMTP host for sending emails. For example, use `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail.

#### `spring.mail.port`: 
- The SMTP port. For Gmail's SMTP, this is typically `587`.

#### `spring.mail.username`: 
- Your email address used for sending emails.

#### `spring.mail.password`:  
- The app-specific password generated by your email provider.
- For Gmail, you can create this password under your Google Account settings `(Security > App Passwords)`.

#### `security.jwt.access-token.secret`: 
- A secret key for signing JWT tokens. 
- You can generate an appropriate jwt secret using:
- ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 129 | tr -d '\n'
  ```

#### `security.jwt.access-token.expiration`: 
- Access token expiration time in milliseconds. 
- Example: `86400000` for 24 hours.

#### `security.jwt.refresh-token.expiration`: 
- Refresh token expiration time in milliseconds.
- Example: `604800000` for 7 days.

### Hereâ€™s an example `application.yml` configuration:
```yaml
spring:
  
  # other configurations...
  
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: YOUR_MONGODB_URI_WITH_CREDENTIALS/YOUR_DB_NAME
      database: YOUR_DB_NAME
      
  # other configurations...
  
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: your-email@gmail.com
    password: your-email-app-password
    
  # other configurations...
  
security:
  jwt:
    access-token:
      secret: YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET
      expiration: 86400000
    refresh-token:
      expiration: 604800000
      
# other configurations...
```
